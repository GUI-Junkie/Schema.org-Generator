Show properties
===============

``accountablePerson`` is a ``Person``

.. raw:: html

    <img src="./_images/D4.png" title="Person" alt="Person" />

By clicking on  ``Person``, we can now see the properties of the schema.

.. raw:: html

    <img src="./_images/D5.png" title="Person properties" alt="Person properties" />

We can add more information as needed. ``Person`` has a ``PostalAddress``

.. raw:: html

    <img src="./_images/D6.png" title="Person PostalAddress" alt="Person PostalAddress" />

.. raw:: html

    <img src="./_images/D7.png" title="Person PostalAddress properties" alt="Person PostalAddress properties" />

Now, we can start to fill out the text fields with the information we **want** to share with the Search Engines. Most fields are optional, but we'll see that later.

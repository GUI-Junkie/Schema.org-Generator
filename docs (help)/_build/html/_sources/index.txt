   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the `Schema Generator` help!
=======================================

I'm assuming the reader is familiar with |html| |external_link|

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 3

    why
    find
    blog
    properties
    fields
    save
    generate
    external
    donate

Where is the tool?
==================

You can use the |Schema Generator| |external_link|

Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`

.. |Readme.txt| raw:: html

   <a href="Readme.txt">Readme.txt</a>

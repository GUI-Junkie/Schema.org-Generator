Pick a schema
=============

We'll pick ``Blog`` as an example

.. raw:: html

    <img src="./_images/D2.png" title="Blog" alt="Blog" />

Having chosen a schema, we can now see the properties of the schema. We can also observe the ``Save Schema`` and ``Generate Schema`` buttons appearing. More on these later.

.. raw:: html

    <img src="./_images/D3.png" title="Blog Properties" alt="Blog Properties" />

Links with the |external_link| image will lead to a |schema.org| |external_link| page in a different tab for further information. :doc:`external`

Links without this |external_link| image will show the properties of that schema. For instance the first property of ``Blog`` is ``about``. ``about`` is a ``Thing``. Clicking on ``Thing`` will show the properties of ``Thing``.

:doc:`properties`
